# Lab 0 - Getting Started with GitHub Classroom

## Objective

Familiarize students with the process of using GitHub Classroom for submitting assignments by creating and submitting a basic Java program.

## Instructions

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation and clone the assignment repository to your local machine.
2. Open the assignment in your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).
3. In the folder src/main, there is a file called Greeting.java. Inside the file add a new Java class named Greeting with a main method.
4. In the main method, write a program that prompts the user to enter their name and then prints a personalized greeting message to the console (e.g., "Hello, [name]! Welcome to GitHub Classroom!").
5. To print, create/use a method called _generateGreeting_ that takes the name as a parameter and then prints the greeting message
6. Add comments to your code to explain your logic and thought process.
7. Commit your changes to your local repository, and push your completed assignment to the GitHub Classroom repository.

## Evaluation Criteria:

1. Code correctness: Your code should compile without errors and produce the expected output.
2. Code organization: Use appropriate Java class and method structure, and follow Java naming conventions.
3. Code readability: Add comments to your code to explain your thought process and the purpose of each code block.

This assignment aims to help you become comfortable with the process of using GitHub Classroom for submitting assignments. Good luck, and enjoy using GitHub Classroom!
